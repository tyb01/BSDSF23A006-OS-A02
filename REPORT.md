How ANSI escape codes work + green example: Terminals interpret sequences beginning with ESC (\033[), parameters, and m to set styles. Example for green: "\033[0;32mYourText\033[0m".

Which st_mode bits to check for executability: Check S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, S_IXOTH (owner, group, others). If any are set, the file is executable by that class.
